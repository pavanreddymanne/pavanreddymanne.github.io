I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Computing and Electrical Engineering](https://scee.iitmandi.ac.in) at [Indian Institute of Technology Mandi](https://www.iitmandi.ac.in). Before joining IIT Mandi, I worked as Principal Architect at [WiSig Networks](https://wisig.com), led the mac-layer development for 5G base-station and contributed to 4G and narrowband-IoT technologies, building over 8 years of hands-on industry experience in wireless communication systems. I received my M.Tech. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in), where my doctoral work was recognized with the IEEE GraTE7 Best Ph.D. Thesis Award for the year 2022. My research focuses on the design and analysis of next-generation wireless systems, including physical layer algorithms, protocol stack and scheduler designs, massive MIMO and beamforming, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, machine learning based network architectures, and development of prototypes for emerging wireless technologies. Check [Research](./research) and [Publications](./articles) pages for more details about my work.
