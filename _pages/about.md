I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Computing and Electrical Engineering](https://scee.iitmandi.ac.in) at [Indian Institute of Technology Mandi](https://www.iitmandi.ac.in). Before joining IIT Mandi, I worked as Principal Architect at [WiSig Networks](https://wisig.com), leading 5G base-station development, following earlier R&D roles focused on building 4G and 5G cellular systems. I received my M.Tech. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in), where my doctoral work was recognized with the IEEE GraTE7 Best Ph.D. Thesis Award for the year 2022. My research focuses on building and analyzing next-generation wireless systems through innovations in communication theory, signal processing, scheduler designs, massive MIMO and beamforming, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and machine learning driven network architectures. Check [Research](./research) and [Publications](./articles) pages for more details about my work.
<!--I work in the areas of communications and signal processing, scheduler designs for cellular technologies, massive MIMO and beamforming, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and machine learning applications in wireless systems.
